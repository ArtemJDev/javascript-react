# Practice JS and React (stopped...)

## Hi all, my name is Artem!  
Initially, this repository was created only for the practice of FS, 
but gradually it became for me as a repository of convenient solutions and techniques in coding.

## Structure
* React-test-component  
(folder for the practice of  React, in the example I create a simple site using the component approach)
* JS-pract  
(testing of the components and various parts of the site)
    * [Elements](https://github.com/ArtemJDev/javascript-react/tree/master/js-pract/lessons-pract/elements)  
    (practical use of skills and the creation of various elements for the site)
    * [Ud-acv](https://github.com/ArtemJDev/javascript-react/tree/master/js-pract/lessons-pract/ud-acv)
    * [Ud-ilien](https://github.com/ArtemJDev/javascript-react/tree/master/js-pract/lessons-pract/ud-iilen)  
    (both folders - training projects)
    
## What next
Now I do not update this repository, I concentrate all my time on improving programming skills in Java.  
But I hope that soon I will continue to fill it.
